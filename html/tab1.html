  <li>Electric energy</li>
  <p>
    This contact causes an electrical current that consists of the transmission
    of negative charges (electrons) through a suitable material (such as metals)
    from the point of generation (and/or storage) to the point of consumption.
    Usually electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy: light,
    mechanical or thermal.
